## Working with the editor

### Setting MIDI connections

When MagicstompFrenzy is run for the first time the Preferences window appears. You have to make connections to the MIDI In and Out ports of the Magicstomp by selecting them in the lists. If no MIDI ports of the Magistomp appear there you have to install the [YAMAHA MIDI USB driver](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/contents/music_production/downloads/firmware_software/index.html?c=music_production&k=USB-MIDI) first and/or connect the Magicstomp to your PC. On Windows no MIDI hotplugging is supported, so you habe to restart the application. After that you can close the preferences window.

### Requesting patches

The main window contains of the patch list window and the patch editor window. The patch list window includes user patch list and three preset patch lists plus buttons to manage patches. First you have to request user patches from the user memory of your Magicstomp. This is done by clicking on the "Request All" button. If your MIDI connection have been set probably you will see user patches being transmitted. This will take about 1 - 2 minutes for all 100 user patches.

### Editing patches

After that you can edit patches. To choose the patch to edit double-click on it in the patches list. The chosen patch will be transferred to the temporary memory of your Magicstomp and will become the "active" patch. This will also activate the editor window. In this window you can change the parameters of the chosen patch. The changes will become audible immidiately. When a patch has been changed it will be also marked with a yellow box in the list. Using the "Undo/Redo" button you can compare the orginal patch with the edited patch.

User patches can be exported into UB9 or SMF file as well.
